## Installation üöÄ

### Standard Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:

   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -U git+https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta.git@development
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   DEFAULT_INTERVAL=60
   ```

### Docker Installation
1. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

## Setup üîß

1. Create a Discord bot using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Enable "Message Content Intent" in the bot settings
   - Generate a bot token
   - Add the bot to your server with necessary permissions

2. Get an OpenRouter API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
   - Sign up for an account
   - Generate an API key
   - Add the key to your .env file

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   DEFAULT_INTERVAL=60
   ```

### Time Interval Configuration ‚è∞

The `DEFAULT_INTERVAL` setting in your `.env` file determines the timeframe for price analysis. Valid intervals are:

- Minutes: '1', '3', '5', '15', '30', '60', '120', '240', '360', '720'
- Daily: 'D' (1440 minutes)
- Weekly: 'W' (10080 minutes)
- Monthly: 'M' (43200 minutes)

Choose an interval that matches your trading strategy. For example:
- Short-term trading: Use shorter intervals (1-15 minutes)
- Swing trading: Use medium intervals (60-240 minutes)
- Long-term analysis: Use longer intervals (D/W/M)

## Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Core Components

- **Main Bot (`main.py`)**: Handles Discord interactions and command processing
- **Command Handler (`command_handler.py`)**: Manages command parsing and execution
- **Price Handler (`price_handler.py`)**: Manages real-time price data and signal generation
- **Strategy Factory (`factory.py`)**: Creates and manages trading strategy instances
- **Base Strategy (`base.py`)**: Provides common interface and functionality for all strategies
- **WebSocket Client (`bybit_ws.py`)**: Maintains real-time connection with Bybit exchange
- **OpenRouter Client (`openrouter_client.py`)**: Handles AI chat functionality

### Strategy System

The bot uses a factory pattern for strategy management:
1. **Base Strategy**: Abstract class defining common interface
   - Market trend analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Volume analysis
   - Dynamic threshold calculation

2. **Strategy Factory**: Central point for strategy creation
   - Manages strategy registration
   - Creates strategy instances
   - Handles strategy configuration

3. **Concrete Strategies**: Implement specific analysis methods
   - RSI with dynamic thresholds
   - MACD with enhanced crossover detection
   - Bollinger Bands with squeeze detection
   - Ichimoku Cloud with crypto-optimized settings

### Signal Generation Process

1. Price data is collected in real-time for all USDT perpetual pairs
2. Each strategy maintains its own DataFrame with required indicators
3. When new data arrives:
   - DataFrames are updated with the latest prices
   - Technical indicators are recalculated
   - Market conditions are analyzed:
     * Trend strength
     * Volume confirmation
     * Pattern recognition
     * Dynamic thresholds
   - Signals are generated with confidence scores
   - High-confidence signals are sent to Discord channel

## AI Chat System ü§ñ

The bot uses OpenRouter's API to provide intelligent responses about:
- Cryptocurrency markets and trading concepts
- Bot features and strategy explanations
- Technical analysis insights

Chat features:
- Focused on crypto/trading topics
- Concise, technical responses
- No financial advice or predictions
- Automatic disclaimers for market-related info
- Response length limited to maintain channel readability

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! The bot is designed to be easily extensible, especially for adding new trading strategies.

To add a new strategy:
1. Create a new strategy class extending `SignalStrategy`
2. Implement required methods:
   - `min_candles` property
   - `calculate_indicator` method
   - `analyze_market` method
3. Add strategy type to `StrategyType` enum
4. Register strategy in `StrategyFactory`

## Troubleshooting üîç

Common issues and solutions:

- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Check your internet connection and Bybit API status
- **Missing Price Data**: Ensure minimum candle requirements are met for your chosen strategy
- **Discord Permission Errors**: Verify bot has proper channel permissions
- **Invalid Interval**: Make sure DEFAULT_INTERVAL in .env is one of the valid values
- **Strategy Errors**: Check log files for specific error messages

## Performance Considerations üöÄ

- Efficient in-memory data structures for price data management
- Strategy-specific window sizes to optimize memory usage
- Factory pattern for efficient strategy instantiation
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Batched signal processing for reduced Discord API calls
